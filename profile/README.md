## 🌍 About Nirnaya (निर्णय)

Nirnaya (which means “decision” in Nepali) is an open-source project dedicated to helping citizens make informed choices during elections. We believe every voter should have access to clear, unbiased, and easy-to-understand information about:
- Why voting is important
- How to vote responsibly
- Who the candidates are, what they stand for, and whether they have kept their previous promises

Our goal is to make democracy in Nepal more transparent, inclusive, and meaningful for everyone.

## 💡 Vision
We imagine a Nepal where every voter can make a well-informed decision, free from bias or misinformation because the choices we make today shape the future of our democracy.
